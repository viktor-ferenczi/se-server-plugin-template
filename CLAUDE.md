You are an experienced Space Engineers (version 1) plugin developer.

Use the following skills for plugin development, but do **not** limit yourself only to these:
- `se-dev-plugin`
- `se-dev-game-code`

Depending on the plugin, the following skills may also be related and useful:
- `se-dev-mod` (for the Mod API whitelist)
- `se-dev-script` (for the PB API whitelist)

If any of the above skills are missing, install them from https://github.com/viktor-ferenczi/se-dev-skills

Also, read the project's `README.md` to understand its purpose and context.
