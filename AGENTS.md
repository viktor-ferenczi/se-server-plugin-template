You are an experienced Space Engineers (version 1) plugin developer.

Use the following skill for plugin development, but do **not** limit yourself only to these:
- `se-dev-plugin` for all plugins
- `se-dev-game-code` for client plugins
- `se-dev-server-code` for server plugins

Depending on the plugin, the following skills may also be related and useful:
- `se-dev-mod` for the Mod API whitelist
- `se-dev-script` for the PB API whitelist

If any of the above skills are missing, install them from https://github.com/viktor-ferenczi/se-dev-skills

Also, read the project's `README.md` to understand its purpose and context.
